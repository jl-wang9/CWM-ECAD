1. Where there any errors? Critical warnings?

Synthesis [4 warnings]

	[Synth 8-85] always block has no event control specified ["/home/centos/CWM-ECAD/Ex8/top.v":64]

	[Synth 8-3331] design top has unconnected port rst_n
		[Synth 8-3331] design top has unconnected port rst_n

	[Constraints 18-5210] No constraints selected for write.
	Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in 	flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write 		synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is 	opened.



2. What is the worst case hold time of the design?

	my WHS is: 0.051 ns



3. What is the worst case setup time of the design?

	my WNS is 9.111 ns


4. How many LUT were used by the design?

	no. of LUTs used is 5


5. How many FF were used by the design?

	no. of FFs used is 2


6. How much block RAM was used by the design?


	Assume block RAM is BRAM, then BRAM used is 0


7. What is the expected power consumption of the design?

	Power = 2.474W


8. How long did it take to synthesize and implement the design?

	synth_1 took 03min 55s
	impl_1 took 14min 00s

	totalling 17min 55s
